# scientificCalculator
This project, when complete, will be a fully-functional scientific calculator, with the graphics of a physical calculator.

Started project. Calculator works for all single-digit inputs, excluding use of brackets and indices.
Update: now works for indices. Brackets are yet to be functional. Created a new file 'parentheses.py' to experiment with a recursive calculator.
Update: Now fully functional for single-digit numbers. Brackets work - abandoned parentheses.py file, however a recursive approach may be retrialed later. This version is still recursive but vastly different to what I had planned.
